# The worlds coordinate system is right-handed: x to the right, y up, z out of the screen

# The world geometry is made of "brushes". A brush is a cuboid.
# Its position is made of the first tuple of 3 integer coordinates in the world. In the engine, the
# dimensions of the grid are 1024.0 x 1024.0 x 1024.0. So, a cube at (0, 1, 2) will
# appear at (1x1024.0, 2x1024.0, 0x1024.0) = (1024.0, 2048.0, 0.0).
# A cube has a positive height. The height may be larger than the world grid's
# height (1024.0). So, a cube is always 1024.0x1024.0 in x and z, but
# it can be lower or higher than 1024.0.
# The texture is the texture being used in textures/*.<image-filename>.
# Textures must be 32 bit RGBA per pixel.

# Brush data: <int>, <int>, <int>, <name>,       <float>
#             pos                , texture name, height
